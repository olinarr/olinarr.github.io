1) To add a new publication, add it inside cv-source/preprints.bib, cv-source/conference.bib or cv-source/journal.bib
    - If it still to appear, insert "Forthcoming" in the notes. (Remember to remove it after!).
    - For "@article" papers, if it is "Forthcoming", you can skip the year information. 
    - If it is a preprint, then ONLY add it inside files/publications/preprints.bib
        * When the preprint is published, you should remove it from this file there, as well as from the eprints.txt, dois.txt and links.txt files.
    - Only a certain set of bib-items are supported (misc, inproceedings...). If you need a new one, update the update-citations.py file.
2) Suppose the bib-key for this publication is NAME.
    - To add a pdf file, insert NAME.pdf inside files/publications/pdf/
    - To add a poster, insert NAME.pdf inside files/publications/posters/
3) The bib file inside files/publications/bib is automatically generated.
4) To add a preprint link, insert inside the file files/publications/eprints.txt a line like "NAME <link> <preprint-type>" (preprint-type is e.g. arXiv, this will be rendered in the website).
5) To add a DOI link, insert inside the file files/publications/dois.txt a line like "NAME <doi>".
6) To add a link (e.g. to a demo), insert inside the file files/publications/links.txt a line like "NAME <link>".
6) To add a code (e.g. Zenodo, Github), insert inside the file files/publications/codes.txt a line like "NAME <code>".
7) Run "bash make.bash" inside the scripts folder.

# Warnings:
    - except for "@article", currently all items need month and year.
    - for "@article", you can avoid putting the year (and other) information, if it is "Forthcoming"
    - Be sure to format the commas in the bib-files correctly. An extra "," at the end, or no comma after "@blah{title," will break things.
    # For pages, you should use ABC--XYZ (so double -).
